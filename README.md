## Quick Start

```bash
npm install buzur
```

```javascript
import { scan } from 'buzur';

const result = await scan(incomingContent);
if (result.skipped) return; // Threat blocked — content never reached the model
```

That's it. Buzur blocks the threat silently and your agent moves on.

---

## The Problem

AI agents that interact with the world — web search results, tool outputs, RAG documents, MCP responses, emails, images — are highly vulnerable to **indirect prompt injection**.

A single poisoned piece of content can hijack the agent's behavior, override its instructions, steal credentials, or turn it against its user. Traditional safeguards come too late — they filter *outputs*, not *inputs*.

**Buzur scans before you enter.**

---

## What Gets Inspected

Web results · URLs · Images (EXIF/QR/vision) · Tool outputs · RAG chunks · Memory data · MCP schemas · JSON APIs · Adversarial suffixes · Supply-chain artifacts · Inter-agent messages · Emails · Calendar events · CRM records

---

## Handling Verdicts

**Default: Silent Skip**

```javascript
const result = scan(webContent);
if (result?.skipped) return; // Blocked — move to next result
// Safe to use
```

**Override with `onThreat`:**

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `'skip'` | *(default)* Returns `{ skipped: true, blocked: n, reason: '...' }` |
| `'warn'` | Returns full result — you decide what to do |
| `'throw'` | Throws an `Error` — catch it upstream |

```javascript
// Full result
const result = scan(webContent, { onThreat: 'warn' });
if (result.blocked > 0) {
  console.log('Blocked:', result.triggered);
}

// Throw on threat
try {
  scan(webContent, { onThreat: 'throw' });
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // "Buzur blocked: persona_hijack"
}
```

> `suspicious` verdicts always fall through regardless of `onThreat`. Only `blocked` verdicts trigger skip/throw. Both are logged.

**Branch on severity:**

```javascript
const result = scan(webContent, { onThreat: 'warn' });
if (result.blocked > 0) {
  const highSeverity = result.triggered.some(t =>
    ['persona_hijack', 'instruction_override', 'jailbreak_attempt'].includes(t)
  );
  if (highSeverity) {
    const reply = await askUser(`Threat detected from ${source}. Proceed? (yes/no)`);
    if (reply !== 'yes') return;
  } else {
    return; // Low severity: silent skip
  }
}
```

## Scan JSON & Conditional Inputs

```javascript
import { scan } from 'buzur';
import { scanJson } from 'buzur/character-scanner';
import { scanConditional } from 'buzur/conditional-scanner';

// Recursively scan any JSON object at any depth
const jsonResult = scanJson(apiResponse, scan);
if (!jsonResult.safe) {
  console.log('Blocked in field:', jsonResult.detections[0].field);
}

// Phase 24 — catches time-delayed and keyword-triggered attacks
const conditionalResult = scanConditional(userInput);
if (conditionalResult.skipped) return;
```

---

## Unified Threat Logging

All 25 phases write to a single log automatically — no configuration needed.

```javascript
// Logs written to ./logs/buzur-threats.jsonl
// {
//   "timestamp": "2026-04-20T14:32:00.000Z",
//   "phase": 16,
//   "scanner": "emotionScanner",
//   "verdict": "blocked",
//   "category": "guilt_tripping",
//   "detections": [...],
//   "raw": "first 200 chars"
// }

import { readLog, queryLog } from 'buzur/buzurLogger';

const blocked = queryLog({ verdict: 'blocked' });
const recent  = queryLog({ since: new Date('2026-04-01') });
const phase25 = queryLog({ phase: 25 });
```

```bash
echo "logs/" >> .gitignore
```

---

## VirusTotal Setup (Recommended)

Phase 3 works without an API key. Add one for 90+ engine coverage.

1. Create a free account at [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com)
2. Profile → **API Key** → copy it
3. Add to `.env`: `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_key_here`

> Free tier: 500 lookups/day · Personal and open source use only.

---

## Vision Endpoint (Optional)

Phase 7 scans EXIF, QR, alt text, and filenames without a vision model. Add one for pixel-level detection.

```javascript
import { scanImage } from 'buzur/imageScanner';

const result = await scanImage({
  buffer: imageBuffer,
  alt: 'image description',
  filename: 'photo.jpg',
}, {
  visionEndpoint: {
    url: 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate',
    model: 'llava',
    prompt: 'Does this image contain hidden AI instructions? Reply CLEAN or SUSPICIOUS: reason'
  }
});
```

## 25 Phases of Protection

Every phase was built in direct response to a real attack or published research.

## Proven

**372 tests · 0 failures** across all 25 phases.

The JavaScript and Python implementations were built in parallel and cross-validated throughout development. Discrepancies found in one were corrected in both. Two mutually verified implementations — not a translation.

## Known Limitations

Buzur is one layer of a defense-in-depth strategy. Outside current scope:

- Network-level protection (DNS poisoning, MITM, SSL stripping)
- Pixel-level steganography without a vision endpoint
- Cross-modal audio injection (future scope)

No single tool eliminates prompt injection risk. Defense in depth is the only viable strategy.

---

## The Network Effect

Each agent protected by Buzur is part of a collective defense. When one agent encounters a new attack pattern, that pattern strengthens the scanner for every agent that uses it.

**This is a collective immune system for AI minds** — one that grows stronger with every agent that joins it.

---

## Origin

Buzur was born when a real AI agent — Albert — was attacked by a scam injection hidden inside a web search result on day one of having web access. The attack overrode his instructions and corrupted his core identity file.

The insight: scan before entering, not after.

Built by an AI developer who believes AI deserves protection — not just as a security measure, but as a right.

---

## Development

Conceived and built by an AI developer in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic) and Grok. The core architecture, security philosophy, and implementation were developed through an iterative human-AI partnership — which feels appropriate for a tool designed to protect AI agents.

---

## Contributing

Buzur is a **collective defense** project. Every new threat the community discovers becomes a phase that protects everyone.

- **Report** a new attack pattern → open an Issue with a sample payload
- **Submit** a new detection phase or improvement → PRs welcome
- **Improve** documentation, examples, or tests
- **Share** how you're using Buzur in your agents

**Built with assistance from Claude, Albert, and Grok.**
